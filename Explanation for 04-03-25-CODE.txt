The code is an updated version from 02-08-25
The code has multiple filtrations for
01) Uncertainty Filtration
02) Photon Filtration
03) ROI region Filtration

Also, it generates a scatter plot which visually shows the that
01) PHI
02) TETHA
03) DISTANCE

On the scatter plots. Now, this code CANNOT be used for timelapses since timelapses require a frame filtration for a frame by frame
analysis. This is the next step, where I do a frame filtration for timelapses

THETA DEF: here the theta angle is defined from the surface to the probe which is UNCONVENTIONAL, but the conventional method confuses everyone so for the time being this is a temporary adjustment
